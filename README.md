    Elaborate further on the design constraints when it comes to building a zkVM, which includes the zero-knowledge proof stack and the virtual machine design.

- **Part Three(WIP) - Exploring zkVM Projects, Comparison, and Future**: 

    Dive into the different designs and implementations of existing zkVM projects, and compare their advantages and disadvantages. And Last I will share a little bit of my thoughts on the future of zkVM.
